/**
 * Bridge between KeyEventHandler and KeyboardReceiver.
 *
 * This class provides the KeyEventHandler.IReceiver implementation that
 * delegates all calls to a KeyboardReceiver instance. It solves the
 * initialization ordering problem where KeyEventHandler needs to be created
 * before KeyboardReceiver, but KeyEventHandler requires an IReceiver.
 *
 * Pattern: Delegation Bridge with Lazy Initialization
 * - KeyEventHandler is created first with this bridge
 * - Bridge holds a reference to KeyboardReceiver (initially null)
 * - KeyboardReceiver is created later and set via setReceiver()
 * - All calls are forwarded to the receiver once set
 *
 * This utility is extracted from Keyboard2.java for better code organization
 * and testability (v1.32.390).
 *
 * @since v1.32.390
