/**
 * Initializes KeyboardReceiver with lazy initialization pattern.
 *
 * This class encapsulates the creation and bridge registration of KeyboardReceiver,
 * which requires 9 dependencies and must be lazily initialized during onStartInputView().
 *
 * The initializer pattern ensures:
 * - KeyboardReceiver is only created once
 * - KeyboardReceiver is properly registered with KeyEventReceiverBridge
 * - All dependencies are provided in a clean, testable way
 *
 * This utility is extracted from Keyboard2.java onStartInputView() as part of Phase 4
 * refactoring to reduce the main class size (v1.32.397).
