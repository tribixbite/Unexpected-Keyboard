/**
 * Propagates SuggestionBar and view references to keyboard managers.
 *
 * This class centralizes the distribution of SuggestionBar and view references
 * to managers that need them:
 * - InputCoordinator: Needs SuggestionBar for prediction display
 * - SuggestionHandler: Needs SuggestionBar for suggestion management
 * - NeuralLayoutHelper: Needs SuggestionBar for neural predictions
 * - KeyboardReceiver: Needs emoji/clipboard pane references
 *
 * The propagator pattern simplifies onStartInputView() by consolidating
 * all reference updates into a single operation.
 *
 * This utility is extracted from Keyboard2.java for better code organization
 * and testability (v1.32.394).

 * @since v1.32.394
