/**
 * Represents a trigram (three-word sequence) with frequency and probability data.
 *
 * Used for enhanced context-aware prediction using two words of context.
 * Trigrams provide stronger context than bigrams for better prediction accuracy.
 *
 * Example: "I want to" → "go" is more likely than just "to" → "go"
 *          "New York" → "City" is very likely
 *
 * @property word1 The first word in the sequence (two words back)
 * @property word2 The second word in the sequence (one word back)
 * @property word3 The third word in the sequence (predicted word)
 * @property frequency How many times this sequence has been observed
 * @property probability P(word3 | word1, word2) = frequency(word1,word2,word3) / frequency(word1,word2)
