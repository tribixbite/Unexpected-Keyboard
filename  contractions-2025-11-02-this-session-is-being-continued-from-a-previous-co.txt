● I need to complete the final tasks: update pm.md with
  all the contraction work completed and make a
  conventional commit.

  Let me first read the current pm.md to see what needs
  updating:

● Read(memory/pm.md)
  ⎿  Read 1424 lines

● I'll now update pm.md with the completed work and make a
   conventional commit.

● Update(memory/pm.md)
  ⎿  Updated memory/pm.md with 64 additions and 3 removal

             working

  - it'll (pronoun)
  - y'all (colloquial)

  ✅ Updated all files:
  - contraction_pairings.json: 1,744 base words
  - contractions_non_paired.json: 62 mappings
  - en_enhanced.json: 49,296 words (62 apostrophe-free
  forms)

  ✅ Complete documentation:
  - docs/specs/CONTRACTION_SYSTEM.md fully rewritten
  - Architecture diagrams, code flow, testing checklist
  - 66 distinct contractions covered

  ✅ Updated pm.md and committed

  Final System:
  - Dictionary: 49,296 words

  - Non-paired: 62 apostrophe-free → proper contractions
  - NN-based filtering working correctly

  The contraction system is now complete and
  production-ready. Test the APK at
  /sdcard/unexpected/debug-kb.apk to verify all
  contractions work correctly.
